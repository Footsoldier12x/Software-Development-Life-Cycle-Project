# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The product owner engaged the client first and collected the initial requirements. The team and scrum master then negotiated which stories they would accept to work during the sprint. However, the client continously gave feedback into the work performed by the developers, further refining the user stories in the backlog. This created more value for the client, accomplishing the goal of the project.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The product owner is primarily in charge of communicating with the client and other stakeholders to prioritize the stories in the backlog. The scrum master assists the product onwer to sort user stories derived from the client's input and mentors the team in agile methodololy to communicate with the client effectively. The team in also in constant communication with the client during development. All roles have one thing in common: empowerment to effectively communicate with the client. This would be the first process I would strive to implement. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Agile is all about change when something is no longer working effectively. If there is no willingness to change to become more effective within an organization, then productivity and quality will be hindered. Being a flexible at every level of the organization, specially at the top, will provide the proper setting to allow change for the better.
